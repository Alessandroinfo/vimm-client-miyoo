## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### Is this App legit?
- It depends on how you are going to use it!! Basically this client is like a Browser pointed to a specific Web page.

### Is the author of this app involved directly with Vimm's Lair somehow?
- Absolutely not, all the games are hosted on Vimm's Lair website and i'm not connected to them in any way.
